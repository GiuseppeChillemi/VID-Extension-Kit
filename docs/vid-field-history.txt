FIELD History

===0.0.5

---Sep 03 2007

:Fix - Error with NONE appearing in the field, when using a specific key range.

:New - Now handles passwords properly with SET-FACE, GET-FACE. Standard FIELD does this incorrectly. This required some changes in SET-FACE and GET-FACE so face text is stored in DATA instead of TEXT. Only limitation at this time is that you can't set the text from LAYOUT. You must use SET-FACE.

===0.0.4

---Mar 29 2007

:New - NAME-FIELD is an example FIELD which will trim the head of the text and capitalize each first letter after a space or at the head. This happens at each key press. Suitable for entering names.

===0.0.3

---Mar 25 2007

:Fix - When <tt>max-length</tt> is used, the field would be locked from editing, if the string length somehow grew longer than given in <tt>max-length</tt>.

:New - <tt>manip-keys</tt> function to determine if +/- or scroll-wheel was used to trigger the <tt>key-action</tt>

:Fix - Rehighlights text after using +/- and scroll-wheel, so you can edit it with keys

:Fix - +/- and scroll-wheel worked on some non-numeric field and replaced the contents with <tt>none</tt>.

:New - Added <tt>back-face</tt> and <tt>next-face</tt> to allow you to tab out of the field to an abitrary face.

===0.0.2

---Mar 24 2007

:New - Added support for +/- and scroll-wheel in numeric fields

:New - Support for direct access to the event port from with in a <tt>key-action</tt> block.

:New - Added <tt>max-length</tt>
