<h2 id="section-1">Introduction</h2>
<blockquote>
<p align="center"><img src="images/style-browser.png"></p>
<p>The VID Extension Kit extends the basic capabilities of VID, while fixing some style bugs.</p>
<h4 id="section-1">The VID Extension Kit is:</h4>
<ul>
<li>A collection of new styles for VID to make it more complete.</li>
<li>Heavy modifications to existing styles to make them more flexible.</li>
<li>A small set of rules defined to restrict, but also lift the capability of the user interface to a new level. This helps to:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Simplify the creation, validation and data gathering of forms.</li>
<li>Provide tabbed keyboard navigation.</li>
<li>Provide a consistent skin across the entire UI using a single skin file.</li>
<li>Provide full window resizing and face alignment extensions in the dialect.</li>
<li>Give a user interface meaning and structure as opposed to being a bunch of faces, you have to address absolutely.</li>
<li>Cleaner usage of accessors.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A collection of functions for managing faces, such as:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Very easy face traversal, moving back and forth, up and down in the face tree. Faces become a bit more aware of their surroundings, although not fully.</li>
<li>Face traversal based on criteria, useful for finding a specific face by style, flag or any other method.</li>
<li>Individual keyboard navigation per style, through the <tt>key-face*</tt> accessor.</li>
<li>Disabling and enabling faces and panels, also with customizable <tt>disable-face*</tt> and <tt>enable-face*</tt> accessors per style.</li>
<li>Validating INPUT faces and panels.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A few new styles that are data-only, i.e. invisible styles that provide new operations to the dialect at parse time and connect faces. This is generally used for field validation for now.</li>
<li>A collection of more sensible requesters that take full advantage of the new window layout, resizing and styles.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="section-1">What the VID Extension Kit tries <strong>not</strong> to do:</h4>
<ul>
<li>It does not try to fix "unfixable" low-level bugs with hundreds of lines of complicated hacks. If something is really hard to fix, it will not be fixed. The philosophy is "generally good design" over "capability at all costs".</li>
<li>It does not use anti-aliased fonts.</li>
<li>It does not provide overly flexible face/graphics layout. No transparent windows or other extensions to the layout engine on a lower level.</li>
<li>It is not an exercise in superior GUI artwork. The VID Extension Kit goes for a Tcl/Tk like UI appearance, but only because it's easy to do and easy to make consistent.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="section-1">This is not the GUI toolkit I was looking for</h4>
<p>There are two famous alternatives to VID:</p>
<table cellspacing="6" border="0" width="95%">
<tr><td width="20">&nbsp;</td><td valign="top" width="80"><b>RebGUI</b></td><td valign="top">by Ashley Trüter, it is a complete rewrite from the ground up to provide a new layout engine and a new style system. It can be found <a href="http://www.dobeash.com/rebgui.html">here</a>.
</td></tr>
<tr><td width="20">&nbsp;</td><td valign="top" width="80"><b>GLayout</b></td><td valign="top">by Maxim Olivier-Adlhoch, it replaces the VID dialect layout while keeping its basic feature set. It can be found <a href="http://www.rebol.org/view-script.r?script=glayout.r">here</a>.

<h3 id="section-1.1">Documentation Notes</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>In this document, certain typefaces are used:</p>
<p><tt>FACE-STYLE-NAME</tt> are written in uppercased fixed width.</p>
<p><tt>function-name</tt> are written in lowercased fixed width.</p>
<p>Program code is written in gray boxes.</p>
<p>All screenshots are grabbed from Windows XP.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="section-2">Getting Started</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>To use the latest build of the VID Extension Kit, use the following line:</p>
<pre>
do http://97.107.135.89/projects/rebol/vid/src/builds/vid-ext-kit.r
</pre>
<p>Note that the URL might change, so you may want to download it locally.</p>
<p>And you are ready to go! Be ware that you can't <tt>'do</tt> the file again in the same console session.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="section-3">Windows</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Creating a window happens with the <tt>make-window</tt> function. This creates a resizable layout with tab navigation.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
main: make-window [
    across
    h3 "Main Window" return
    bar return
    label "Enter Name"
    field return
    ok-cancel
]
</pre>
<p>To view the window:</p>
<pre>
view main
</pre>
<p align="center"><img src="images/example.png"></p>
<p>The use of LAYOUT provides a standard old-style VID window without keyboard navigation or resizing.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="section-4">Dialect</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>There are a few additions to the dialect to facilitate easy access to resizing, alignment and face validation. For basic usage, refer to the original VID Manual.</p>
<p>The additions involve additional words that are available per style for resizing, face setup and defaults:</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-4.1">Setup</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Some faces have settings that are complex enough to warrant a <tt>setup</tt> word in addition to setting colors, size, etc. This for example counts for lists and panels with multiple panes.</p>
<p>Setup can vary between styles, as some are simple data blocks, where others are complete dialects, which describe complex aspects of the face behavior. This is wholly defined by the style in the <tt>setup-face*</tt> accessor and can <i>in some cases</i> be set using the <tt>setup-face</tt> function.</p>
<h4 id="section-4.1.1">Examples</h4>
<pre>
view make-window [
    panel setup [
        general [
            h1 "General"
            ... General setup layout here...
        ]
        network [
            h1 "Network"
            ... network setup layout here...
        ]
        printer [
            h1 "Printer"
            ... printer setup layout here...
        ]
    ]
]
</pre>
<p><i>Note that this list style has not yet been implemented but will be in the near future.</i></p>
<pre>
people: [
    "Luke Lakeswimmer" 24
    "Han Sulu" 31
    "Anakin Lakeswimmer" 46
]

view make-window [
    list-view setup [
        source people
        header [name age]
        sort age descending
        scrollers [vertical horizontal]
    ]
]
</pre>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-4.2">Default</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>A face which can have a value set, can now also have a separate default value, using the <tt>default</tt> keyword.</p>
<p>When using the <tt>reset-face</tt> function, the value was usually cleared in the original VID and it was considered that the value set during layout, was the default.</p>
<p>This has been changed to a specific separate <tt>default</tt> value, which you can set during layout. Instead, the value you set beyond the default one, can be seen as an <strong>initial value</strong>, one that only occurs when the layout has been created.</p>
<h4 id="section-4.2.1">Examples</h4>
<p>This will not set an initial value in the field, but when the button is clicked, the field is set to its default value.</p>
<pre>
view make-window [
    field default "Default value"
    button "Set default" [reset-face back-face face]
]
</pre>
<p>This example shows that an initial value is different from a default value.</p>
<pre>
view make-window [
    field "Initial value" default "Default value"
    button "Set default" [reset-face back-face face]
]
</pre>
<p>Defaults can be applied both to single faces and whole panels.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-4.3">Align</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><tt>Align</tt> occurs at layout time and at no other time. It determines how a face should be aligned inside its parent face. Since it only aligns at layout time, a face that is right aligned right when the window is displayed, may no longer be right aligned, when the parent face or the window is resized.</p>
<p>Not using the <tt>align</tt> keyword results in using the default alignment for the style. If there is no align information at all, then the layout engine will not attempt any alignment, defaulting to normal layout. The default for <tt>VID-FACE</tt> is <tt>none</tt>.</p>
<p>Alignment happens with a block of up to four words:</p>
<table cellspacing="6" border="0" width="95%">
<tr><td width="20">&nbsp;</td><td valign="top" width="80"><b>TOP</b></td><td valign="top">This is default and places the top edge of the face near the top edge of the parent face, minus origin spacing.
</td></tr>
<tr><td width="20">&nbsp;</td><td valign="top" width="80"><b>BOTTOM</b></td><td valign="top">This places the bottom edge of the face near the bottom edge of the parent face, minus origin spacing.
</td></tr>
<tr><td width="20">&nbsp;</td><td valign="top" width="80"><b>LEFT</b></td><td valign="top">This is default and places the left edge of the face near the left edge of the parent face, minus origin spacing.
</td></tr>
<tr><td width="20">&nbsp;</td><td valign="top" width="80"><b>RIGHT</b></td><td valign="top">This places the right edge of the face near the right side of the parent face, minus origin spacing.
</td></tr>
<tr><td width="20">&nbsp;</td><td valign="top" width="80"><b>CENTER</b></td><td valign="top">This places the face at the center of the parent face.
</td></tr>
</table>
<p>At no time will the alignment attempt to place the face edges outside the parent-face, unless there is too little room for the face.</p>
<p>You can freely combine the words. A combination of <tt>top</tt> and <tt>bottom</tt> or <tt>left</tt> and <tt>right</tt> will respectively place the face at the vertical or horizontal middle of the parent face.</p>
<div class="note"><p><b></b></p>
<p>The <tt>align</tt> word is also used for aligning text. Giving a word instead of a block, will align the face text instead of the face itself.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="section-4.3.1">Examples</h4>
<pre>
button align [right bottom]
</pre>
<p align="center"><img src="images/align1.png"></p>
<pre>
button align [left right]
</pre>
<p align="center"><img src="images/align2.png"></p>
<pre>
button align [top bottom]
</pre>
<p align="center"><img src="images/align3.png"></p>
<pre>
button align [center]
</pre>
<p align="center"><img src="images/align4.png"></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-4.4">Fill</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><tt>Fill</tt> occurs at layout time and at no other time. It determines whether to fill the remaining space from the current offset to the edge of the parent face minus spacing. This is given as a <tt>pair!</tt> value of either 0 or 1 in the specified direction. For example <tt>0x1</tt> means <i>fill vertically</i>.</p>
<p>Not using the <tt>fill</tt> keyword results in using the default fill for the style. The default fill for <tt>VID-FACE</tt> 0x0.</p>
<h4 id="section-4.4.1">Examples</h4>
<pre>
button fill 0x0
</pre>
<p align="center"><img src="images/fill1.png"></p>
<pre>
button fill 1x0
</pre>
<p align="center"><img src="images/fill2.png"></p>
<pre>
button fill 0x1
</pre>
<p align="center"><img src="images/fill3.png"></p>
<pre>
button fill 1x1
</pre>
<p align="center"><img src="images/fill4.png"></p>
<p>This example shows that filling takes place from the offset point of the face to the right and/or bottom sides of the parent face.</p>
<pre>
at 30x0 button fill 1x0
</pre>
<p align="center"><img src="images/fill5.png"></p>
<h4 id="section-4.4.2">Current Limitations for Align and Fill</h4>
<p>The alignment process does a few things to automate alignment of faces, but some alignments are not possible to do, since faces are generally not aware of the positions of each-other in this resizing system.</p>
<p>When using <tt>align</tt> on two faces that are right next to each other, both faces will ignore each other and simply align to the parent face:</p>
<pre>
view make-window [
    across
    button 150 align [right]
    button align [right]
]
</pre>
<p align="center"><img src="images/alignproblem1.png"></p>
<p>Also, the layout engine will still apply the normally necessary cursor movement in preparation for placing the next face, even if the specified alignment will not place the face near that position at all. This can be seen here, where the second button should be at the location of the first button:</p>
<pre>
view make-window [
    panel 200x200 [
        across
        button align [bottom]
        button
    ]
]
</pre>
<p align="center"><img src="images/alignproblem2.png"></p>
<p>The way to solve this, is to use the <tt>at</tt> keyword, to place the face that was unintentionally moved:</p>
<pre>
view make-window [
    panel 200x200 [
        across
        button align [bottom]
        at 0x0 button
    ]
]
</pre>
<p align="center"><img src="images/alignproblem3.png"></p>
<p>When using <tt>fill</tt>, the face will be filled unconditionally to the edge of its parent, and thus may layout on top of other faces:</p>
<pre>
view make-window [
    across
    box "Red Box" red fill 1x0
    box "Yellow Box" yellow fill 0x1
    return
    button 150
]
</pre>
<p>As seen in the two examples above, it's also sometimes necessary to specify the size of the face. This goes for cases where you can't use <tt>fill</tt> to get the size you want.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/fillproblem1.png"></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-4.5">Spring</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><tt>Spring</tt> has to do with resizing only and is processed every time the layout is resized. It is not used during layout.</p>
<p>Springs are atomic: They are either there or they are not. There are no inbetweens or weighting for springs. There are four springs, one for each side of the face, you want to apply springs to.</p>
<p>When applying a spring, the distance between the face and the parent face varies linearly 1:1 with the parent face edge on the same side. When two springs on opposite sides are applied, the distance varies linearly 1:2.</p>
<p>Not using springs, causes the use of the springs set by default for the style. The default springs for <tt>VID-FACE</tt> (the overall base face for all styles) is <tt>[right bottom]</tt>.</p>
<p>The springs:</p>
<table cellspacing="6" border="0" width="95%">
<tr><td width="20">&nbsp;</td><td valign="top" width="80"><b>TOP</b></td><td valign="top">This places a spring above the face. It's useful in cases where you want a face to stay near the bottom of the parent face.
</td></tr>
<tr><td width="20">&nbsp;</td><td valign="top" width="80"><b>LEFT</b></td><td valign="top">This places a spring to the left of the face
</td></tr>
<tr><td width="20">&nbsp;</td><td valign="top" width="80"><b>RIGHT</b></td><td valign="top">This places a spring to the right of the face. This is default for <tt>VID-FACE</tt>.
</td></tr>
<tr><td width="20">&nbsp;</td><td valign="top" width="80"><b>BOTTOM</b></td><td valign="top">This places a spring below the face. This is default for <tt>VID-FACE</tt>.
</td></tr>
</table>
<p>When using the <tt>top</tt> and <tt>bottom</tt> springs or <tt>left</tt> and <tt>right</tt> springs in combination, similarly to <tt>align</tt>, the face can be kept near the center of the window. More accurately, what happens is that the spring adjustment is divided evenly in half for both sides.</p>
<h4 id="section-4.5.1">Examples</h4>
<p>This causes the buttom to vary its distance to the top of its parent:</p>
<pre>
button spring [top]
</pre>
<p>This is default for <tt>VID-FACE</tt>:</p>
<pre>
button spring [bottom right]
</pre>
<p>This varies the distance between the spring and the left side of the parent face:</p>
<pre>
button spring [left]
</pre>
<p>This causes the button never to resize:</p>
<pre>
button spring [top bottom left right]
</pre>
<p>This causes the button to follow the parent face size on all sides:</p>
<pre>
button spring none
</pre>
<h4 id="section-4.5.2">General Example</h4>
<p>Combining <tt>fill</tt>, <tt>align</tt> and <tt>spring</tt> provides the full subset of features necessary to create a fully resizable layout.</p>
<p>This is a base layout that works well with putting a list in the left side and content selected from the list in the right side, such as what the style browser uses. The layout consists of a left panel that only adjusts vertically and a right panel that adjusts vertically and horizontally without moving its offset:</p>
<pre>
view make-window [
    across
    panel spring [right] [
        box 100x200 spring none blue "Left"
    ]
    panel spring none [
        box 200x170 spring none green "Right"
        box 200x28 spring [top] red "Bottom"
        at 0x0 ; to avoid blank space
        box 40x30 orange align [top right] spring [left bottom]
    ]
    return
    box 0x30 fill 1x0 spring [top] gray "Button Area"
]
</pre>
<h5 id="section-4.5.2.1">Explanation</h5>
<ol>
<li>The first panel has only a right spring, to keep it from resizing up horizontally. Since there are no other springs, the three other sides will follow the size of the parent sides respectively.</li>
<li>The second panel has no springs in order to follow all four sides of the parent. Note that this means <i>the distance to the parent sides is therefore always constant</i>.</li>
<li>The blue box has no springs, to wholly follow the size of the parent panel. There is no alignment, since it sits in the upper left corner of the parent face and there is no fill, as the size of the box defines the size of the parent face, so it automatically fills the whole parent face.</li>
<li>The green box must follow all sides of the parent face to</li>
<li>The orange box will align to the top right on top of the green box. It will not resize due to the left and bottom springs. Instead the springs will cause it to stay at the top right of the green box. Note the use of <tt>at 0x0</tt> before the orange box is declared; This is to avoid the box creating a space between the bottom of the green box and the top of the gray box as the layout engine normally would. Placing the orange box at 0x0 prior to alignment will not cause the problem to occur.</li>
<li>The gray box has a fill to calculate the horizontal size in relation to its parent face, which is the window. It has a specific vertical size, and the horizontal size is simply ignored (here set to 0). The top spring makes sure it stays at the bottom. There is no alignment, because the initial position happens to be correct for the box in this layout.</li>
</ol>

<p>After resizing it up:</p>

</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-4.6">Validate</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The <tt>validate</tt> keyword has a block argument that holds the code to determine what the correct validation for the face is. You can return any value, but it's processed as <tt>logic!</tt> internally. When logically <tt>true</tt>, the face is valid. If <tt>false</tt>, the face is invalid.</p>
<p>Validation occurs on unfocusing the face.</p>
<h4 id="section-4.6.1">Example</h4>
<pre>
field validate [not empty? get-face face]
</pre>
<h4 id="section-4.6.2">Good Validation Principles</h4>
<p>Validation makes the most sense, when using the <tt>VALID-INDICATOR</tt> style for validation as well as the presence of a <tt>TRUE-BUTTON</tt> face, such as that seen in the <tt>USE-CANCEL</tt> style. This allows the VID Extension Kit to perform validation as automatically as possible.</p>
<p>Whenever a window is opened, initial condition validation is performed. This ensures that faces that are required for validation have their <tt>VALID-INDICATOR</tt>s properly marked up. This makes the form ready for initial use.</p>
<h5 id="section-4.6.2.1">Examples</h5>
<p>This uses the <tt>VALID-INDICATOR</tt> style to indicate whether the face is valid or not. Note that the <tt>VALID-INDICATOR</tt> must be positioned immediately after the face to be validated.</p>
<pre>
view make-window [
    across field validate [not empty? get-face face] valid-indicator
]
</pre>
<p>When initial condition validation is performed, before the fields are touched by the user:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/validation1.png"></p>
<p>After validation (by pressing tab):</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/validation2.png"></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-4.7">Required</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The <tt>required</tt> keyword is part of validation. When used, a validation failure will cause an overall error, that considers the form not to be valid for submission. If not used, validation may fail, but is not critical and the form can still be submitted.</p>
<p>The <tt>required</tt> keyword does not work without a <tt>validate</tt> block.</p>
<h4 id="section-4.7.1">Example</h4>
<p>Field may not be empty:</p>
<pre>
field required validate [not empty? get-face face]
</pre>
<p>When used in combination with the <tt>VALID-INDICATOR</tt> style, you get more substantial results:</p>
<pre>
view make-window [
    across
    field required validate [not empty? get-face face]
    valid-indicator
]
</pre>
<p>When initial condition validation is performed, before the fields are touched by the user:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/validation3.png"></p>
<p>After validation (by pressing tab):</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/validation4.png"></p>
<p>After validation failure (by deleting content and pressing tab):</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/validation5.png"></p>
<h4 id="section-4.7.2">The Validation Object</h4>
<p>Whenever the <tt>validate</tt> keyword is used, a validation object, called <tt>face/valid</tt> is created for the face:</p>
<pre>
make object! [
    action:         ; the block to be run for validation
    result: none    ; the result of the validation
    required: false ; whether the face must pass validation
]
</pre>
<p><tt>face/valid/result</tt> can be one of 4 values:</p>
<table cellspacing="6" border="0" width="95%">
<tr><td width="20">&nbsp;</td><td valign="top" width="80"><b>NOT-REQUIRED</b></td><td valign="top">The face is not required for validation. This is used if the face fails validation or does not require validation, because it's disabled. Failure is not critical. This would be displayed in the <tt>VALID-INDICATOR</tt>.
</td></tr>
<tr><td width="20">&nbsp;</td><td valign="top" width="80"><b>REQUIRED</b></td><td valign="top">The face is required for validation, but has not yet been validated. This would show after opening the window. In this case <tt>face/valid/required</tt> would be <tt>true</tt>.
</td></tr>
<tr><td width="20">&nbsp;</td><td valign="top" width="80"><b>INVALID</b></td><td valign="top">The validation failed critically for the face and this would block closing the window.
</td></tr>
<tr><td width="20">&nbsp;</td><td valign="top" width="80"><b>VALID</b></td><td valign="top">The face has been validated and is valid.
</td></tr>
</table>
<h4 id="section-4.7.3">Prepare for Submission</h4>
<p>The submission process is manually handled by you, but in order to get there, the VID Extension Kit can use specific submission buttons to let you know in a simple way whether it's OK to submit the form.</p>
<p>This takes place in the form of a <tt>TRUE-BUTTON</tt>. You can use the <tt>TRUE-BUTTON</tt> directly, but a derivative located inside one of the standard button panels, such as <tt>USE-CANCEL</tt> or <tt>OK-CANCEL</tt>, offers a more complete solution.</p>
<h5 id="section-4.7.3.1">Example</h5>
<pre>
view make-window [
    across
    field required validate [not empty? get-face face] valid-indicator
    return
    true-button "Submit"
]
</pre>
<p>Before touching the form, the initial condition validation has been done:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/submit1.png"></p>
<p>When clicking the submit button without entering anything in the field, the window remains open and the error is indicated:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/submit2.png"></p>
<p>When entering a string in the field and then pressing the submit button, the window is closed, because the form is now valid.</p>
<p>To see, how the submitted result is handled, please visit the <strong>Returning from View Windows and Informs</strong> in the <strong>Special Style Features</strong> section below.</p>
<h4 id="section-4.7.4">General Examples</h4>
<p>This example shows a simple form:</p>
<pre>
empty-field: [not empty? get-face face]
numeric-field: [attempt [to-integer get-face face]]

view make-window [
    across
    label "First Name"
        field required validate empty-field
        valid-indicator return
    label "Last Name"
        field required validate empty-field
        valid-indicator return
    label "Age"
        field validate numeric-field
        valid-indicator return
    label "Comment"
        field validate empty-field
        valid-indicator return
    use-cancel
]
</pre>
<p align="center"><img src="images/validation6.png"></p>
<p>If you click "Use" without entering data, the window will stay open and indicate which fields are invalid and focus the first invalid field:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/validation7.png"></p>
<p>This example is the same, only there are <tt>ENABLER</tt> faces in the layout:</p>
<pre>
view make-window [
    across
    label "First Name"
        enabler true
        field required validate empty-field
        valid-indicator return
    label "Last Name"
        enabler
        field required validate empty-field
        valid-indicator return
    label "Age"
        enabler
        field validate numeric-field
        valid-indicator return
    label "Comment"
        enabler
        field validate empty-field
        valid-indicator return
    use-cancel
]
</pre>
<p>Read more about the <tt>ENABLER</tt> style in the <strong>Special Style Features</strong> section below.</p>
<p>NOTE: In this screenshot, disabled fields do not appear disabled due to unimplemented effects. This will be fixed in a later build.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/validation8.png"></p>
<h4 id="section-4.7.5">Current Limitations</h4>
<p>Due to limitations in <tt>next-face</tt>, <tt>back-face</tt> and <tt>traverse-face</tt>, it's not possible to validate across several panes in a panel. You can only validate the currently visible pane.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-4.8">Origin</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The <tt>origin</tt> keyword is always a pair and is usually given during layout time, either by you or internally by the LAYOUT function. This allows alignment to use the correct distance to the bottom and right edges of the parent face.</p>
<p><tt>Origin</tt> is set for the parent face and then used to place faces inside that parent face. The <tt>fill</tt> and <tt>align</tt> keywords take origin information into account.</p>
<pre>
view make-window [origin 4 button button]
</pre>
<p align="center"><img src="images/origin4.png"></p>
<pre>
view make-window [origin 8 button button]
</pre>
<p align="center"><img src="images/origin8.png"></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-4.9">Space</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>This defines the spacing between faces during a normal layout situation. The standard size is 4x4 pixels. It can be defined both as an <tt>integer!</tt>, used in both directions, or as a <tt>pair!</tt>.</p>
<p><tt>Space</tt> is set for the individual panel levels. This means when defining a new panel, the spacing inside it, will be the default 4x4 pixels.</p>
<p><tt>Space</tt> has no effect on <tt>spring</tt>, <tt>align</tt> or <tt>fill</tt>.</p>
<pre>
view make-window [space 4 button button return button button]
</pre>
<p align="center"><img src="images/space4.png"></p>
<pre>
view make-window [space 12 button button return button button]
</pre>
<p align="center"><img src="images/space12.png"></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-4.10">At</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The <tt>at</tt> keyword is used to place faces at specific locations during layout time. The input is a <tt>pair!</tt>. When this happens, layout is temporarily moved to that face until the next face is to be layed out.</p>
<p>This affects <tt>fill</tt>, but is overwritten by <tt>align</tt>. It does not affect <tt>spring</tt>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-4.11">Aspect</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The <tt>aspect</tt> keywords sets fixed aspect for the face. In combination with <tt>fill</tt>, the face will be resized with a fixed aspect ratio. Fixed aspect ratio is usable in styles where you need to display a scalable print preview or a picture and you don't want to stretch it unintentionally.</p>
<p>The aspect ratio itself is derived from the original size of the face. This is useful in cases where you would set the face to a specific image and want to keep the aspect ratio fixed throughout the time this image is displayed. When switching to a different image, the aspect ratio would change, but again remain fixed there during resizing.</p>
<p>There are 4 modes for <tt>fill</tt> when <tt>aspect</tt> is enabled:</p>
<table cellspacing="6" border="0" width="95%">
<tr><td width="20">&nbsp;</td><td valign="top" width="80"><b>0x0</b></td><td valign="top">Fixed aspect resizing is ignored.
</td></tr>
<tr><td width="20">&nbsp;</td><td valign="top" width="80"><b>0x1</b></td><td valign="top">Fixed aspect calculation is done according to vertical size of parent-face as reference. The result is a face that stays vertically in the confines of the parent face. If the horizontal size of the face is bigger than the parent face, it will go outside the parent face.
</td></tr>
<tr><td width="20">&nbsp;</td><td valign="top" width="80"><b>1x0</b></td><td valign="top">Fixed aspect calculation is done according to horizontal size of parent-face as reference. The result is a face that stays horizontally in the confines of the parent face. If the vertical size of the face is bigger than the parent face, it will go outside the parent face.
</td></tr>
<tr><td width="20">&nbsp;</td><td valign="top" width="80"><b>1x1</b></td><td valign="top">Fixed aspect calculation is done according to both vertical and horizontal size of parent-face as reference. The result is a fixed aspect face that stays within the confines of the parent face no matter the aspect of the parent face.
</td></tr>
</table>
<h5 id="section-4.11">Example</h5>
<p>This will make the box center and scale between the top and bottom and the horizontal size is then scaled for aspect. This means if the aspect ratio is lower than that of the box, the box will be clipped in the sides, but stay centered.</p>
<pre>
view make-window [
    box "+" red
        edge [size: 2x2]    ; for visibility
        spring [left right] ; horizontal center
        fill 0x1            ; fill to top and bottom in parent-face
        aspect              ; fixed aspect for this face
]
</pre>
<p align="center"><img src="images/fixedaspect0x1.png"></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="section-5">Tab Navigation</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Tab navigation involves simply using the <b>Tab</b> key or Shift-Tab key combination to tab to a specific face. If the face is an editable field, it's focused for editing.
If the face does not contain editable text, you can still use the <b>Space</b> key to invoke the action of the face throug a simulated mouse-click, or whatever key navigation is possible through the <tt>key-face*</tt> accessor for the face.</p>
<p>If a face normally can be tabbed to, but is disabled, the face is skipped.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/top-focus.png"></p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/bottom-focus.png"></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-5.1">How It's Done</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Tab navigation is possible thanks to these features:</p>
<ul>
<li><tt>make-window</tt> installs a set of 4 faces that works as a blue focus ring. This focus ring sits at the tail of the window pane, and it's moved, shown and hidden by internal functions. It also stores the tab-face for the window. Each window has its own <tt>tab-face</tt> and moving between several tab navigated faces should not cause focus to be lost.</li>
<li>Global window <tt>detect</tt> function that serves as the single place to handle the <b>Tab</b> and <b>Space</b> key. There is no need for you to make special arrangements to get tab navigation working.</li>
<li><tt>next-face</tt> and <tt>back-face</tt> functions help determine which face to focus next. This is done using their <tt>/deep</tt> refinements.</li>
<li><tt>Tabbed</tt> flag helps only selecting faces that are suitable for tab navigation. You want, for example, to skip the BAR face or text labels, when tabbing.</li>
<li>The <tt>key-face*</tt> accessor allows you to provide custom navigation options for a single face. <tt>DATA-LIST</tt> for example, allows the use of cursor keys to navigate up and down in a focused list.</li>
<li><tt>tab-face</tt> in each window face to store the current <tt>tab-face</tt>. Multiple windows have each their own <tt>tab-face</tt>.</li>
<li>Various rules come into play, helping to determine which face should be focused on window open using the <tt>init-window</tt> function, the form validation process or panel change.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-5.2">Tabbing Order</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The order of tabbing is decided from the order of faces in the face tree. If the face pane contains 4 faces, the first one is focused first, then the second one and then the third and so on.</p>
<p>If any face has a sub pane, each sub pane is investigated for focusable faces and it will focus those. The pane level for tabbing can be infinitely deep.</p>
<p>Tabbing backward goes exactly in reverse of tabbing forward.</p>
<p>Tabbing is done using the <tt>next-face/deep</tt> and <tt>back-face/deep</tt> functions.</p>
<h4 id="section-5.2.1">Current Limitations</h4>
<p>At this time, it's not possible to set a custom tabbing order.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-5.3">Tab Face</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The <tt>tab-face</tt> for a given window can be reached through the window root face, either by accessing the window face directly, or by using <tt>get-tab-face</tt> on a face in the window, if you don't know the window face. The <tt>tab-face</tt> is simply the face currently in focus by the focus ring.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-5.4">Focus Ring</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The focus ring consists of four separate faces, both for speed, as four small faces are faster to draw than one big face, and also due to limitations in the event model in that you can't click to focus through a face with the mouse.</p>
<p>The focus ring color is determined from <tt>system/view/vid/vid-colors/focus-ring-color</tt></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-5.5">Examples</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Use <b>Tab</b> to navigate between button and fields. Use <b>Space</b> on button to clear the fields.</p>
<pre>
view make-window [
    panel [
        across
        label "First Name" field return
        label "Last Name" field return
    ]
    button "Clear" [clear-face back-face face]
]
</pre>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="section-6">Requesters</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>There are various types of requesters. All requesters are blocking, which means the program does not continue, until the requester is closed.</p>
<p>The list of requesters is small, but growing:</p>
<table cellspacing="6" border="0" width="95%">
<tr><td width="20">&nbsp;</td><td valign="top" width="80"><b>MESSAGE</b></td><td valign="top">To display a message with a single Close button and a specific image. Returns FALSE.
</td></tr>
<tr><td width="20">&nbsp;</td><td valign="top" width="80"><b>NOTIFY</b></td><td valign="top">Displays a notification window with a notification icon and a single close button. Returns FALSE.
</td></tr>
<tr><td width="20">&nbsp;</td><td valign="top" width="80"><b>ALERT</b></td><td valign="top">Displays an alert window with an alert icon.
</td></tr>
<tr><td width="20">&nbsp;</td><td valign="top" width="80"><b>REQUEST</b></td><td valign="top">To display a question with a true and false button. Returns TRUE or FALSE, depending on which button was clicked.
</td></tr>
<tr><td width="20">&nbsp;</td><td valign="top" width="80"><b>REQUEST-COLOR</b></td><td valign="top">This displays a window with RGB sliders to select a standard RGB tuple. Returns NONE on no selection or a tuple on selection.
</td></tr>
</table>
<p>More to come in later builds.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="section-7">Skin</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The VID Extension Kit does more to collect all information about colors, fonts, gradients in a single place for easy editing. This could be referred to as a skin system, but at this time, it globally affects all windows, and there is no system in place to handle multiple skins.</p>
<p>However there are formal descriptions of edges, colors and effects. These are made from a purpose driven scheme ("action color"), rather than a description scheme ("red color"), to associate them with the styles more appropriately.</p>
<p>The color list exists in <tt>system/view/vid/vid-colors</tt> and is as follows:</p>
<pre>
vid-colors: context [
    focus-ring-color:       20.120.230
    font-color:             reduce [black focus-ring-color - 75]
    important-font-color:   reduce [white focus-ring-color + 75]
    body-text-color:        black
    title-text-color:       black
    field-color:            snow
    field-select-color:     yello
    window-background-color:180.180.180
    menu-color:             window-background-color + 20
    frame-background-color: window-background-color - 20
    line-color:             window-background-color - 100
    menu-text-color:        [0.0.0 0.75.150 255.255.255]
    important-color:        180.40.0
    manipulator-color:      200.200.200
    action-color:           200.200.200
    true-color:             80.180.80
    false-color:            180.180.180
    action-colors:          reduce [action-color action-color]
    disabled-action-colors: reduce [action-color - 50 action-color - 50]
]
</pre>
<p>A global shortcut to these colors is in <tt>svvc</tt>.</p>
<p>This concept is not entirely followed through. For example, much of the design of a button is stored in the <tt>BUTTON</tt> style itself. This is due to its nature of heavy use of <tt>face/feel/redraw</tt>, which constantly manipulates the colors and gradients directly.</p>
<p>Also certain styles may directly retrieve the calculated color when a face is created in layout, losing the reference to <tt>system/view/vid/vid-colors</tt> which prevents us from changing the color in real-time.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="section-8">VID Functions</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Many new functions have been created for easing the finding of faces in a big layout and managing windows and panes. They are the back bone for many of the new capabilities of VID, such as tab navigation. Most of these functions also end in <tt>*-face</tt>, but are not related to accessor functions.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-8.1">Window</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Windows functions are meant to help in the creation and maintenance of windows.</p>
<h4 id="section-8.1.1"><tt>activate-window</tt></h4>
<p>Activates the given window.</p>
<h4 id="section-8.1.2"><tt>display-window</tt></h4>
<p>This displays a face as a window and manages the face in the window list.</p>
<h4 id="section-8.1.3"><tt>do-window</tt></h4>
<p>Performs a method on the given window, such as activate, maximize, etc.</p>
<h4 id="section-8.1.4"><tt>focus-default-input</tt></h4>
<p>This focuses the first <tt>input</tt> face with a <tt>default</tt> flag set. This is used during the execution of <tt>init-window</tt>. This also sets the focus ring.</p>
<h4 id="section-8.1.5"><tt>focus-first-input</tt></h4>
<p>This focuses the first <tt>input</tt> face. This is used during the execution of <tt>init-window</tt>, usually after a failed <tt>focus-default-input</tt>. This also sets the focus ring.</p>
<h4 id="section-8.1.6"><tt>focus-first-false</tt></h4>
<p>This focuses the first face, which identifies as a false face, such as <tt>FALSE-BUTTON</tt>. This also sets the focus ring. This is used in cases without an input face, such as simple dialogs, where quick key access to a cancel button is the correct method.</p>
<p><tt>flag-face</tt></p>
<p>This sets a flag for a VID face.</p>
<p><tt>flag-face?</tt></p>
<p>This checks for the presence of a specific flag in a VID face.</p>
<h4 id="section-8.1.7"><tt>init-enablers</tt></h4>
<p>This initializes all <tt>ENABLER</tt> styles inside the window.</p>
<h4 id="section-8.1.8"><tt>init-window</tt></h4>
<p>This performs window initialization during VIEW. The ENABLER faces are set, forms are initialized, and it's decided which face to focus first. All operations are done prior to display. A <tt>/focus</tt> refinement determines which face to specifically focus on window open.</p>
<h4 id="section-8.1.9"><tt>layout</tt></h4>
<p>This creates a simple layout from the given dialect block.</p>
<h4 id="section-8.1.10"><tt>make-window</tt></h4>
<p>This creates a resizable window with tab navigation capabilities, focus ring from the given dialect block and stores the <tt>tab-face</tt> for the face.</p>
<h4 id="section-8.1.11"><tt>maximize-window</tt></h4>
<p>Maximizes the given window.</p>
<h4 id="section-8.1.12"><tt>popup?</tt></h4>
<p>Returns whether the window is a popup, shown by <tt>inform</tt>. This is used when closing the window programmatically via <tt>hide-popup</tt> rather than <tt>hide</tt>.</p>
<h4 id="section-8.1.13"><tt>vid-window?</tt></h4>
<p>Determines if the given face is a VID window, i.e. investigates whether the focus ring exists and the style is <tt>window</tt>.</p>
<h4 id="section-8.1.14"><tt>view</tt></h4>
<p>This displays a pre-existing layout created with MAKE-WINDOW or LAYOUT.</p>
<h4 id="section-8.1.15"><tt>window-open?</tt></h4>
<p>Determines if a specific window is visible.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-8.2">Pane</h3>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="section-8.2.1"><tt>find-face</tt></h4>
<p>Returns the pane for the face, for use when figuring out where the face is in the pane.</p>
<h4 id="section-8.2.2"><tt>set-parent-faces</tt></h4>
<p>This function is very important. It sets the parent face for any given face in any layout. As a main rule, in the VID Extension Kit, all faces must have a valid parent face. This function helps that to happen in the creation of windows and panes for panels.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-8.3">Face</h3>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="section-8.3.1"><tt>back-face</tt></h4>
<p>Finds the face prior to the current one in the same pane. Has refinement <tt>/deep</tt> to traverse one step backward deeply in the layout.</p>
<h4 id="section-8.3.2"><tt>click-face</tt></h4>
<p>This simulates a mouse click on a face. This is used during tab navigation, when you press <b>Space</b> to click a button.</p>
<h4 id="section-8.3.3"><tt>describe-face</tt></h4>
<p>This is a quick way to dump important information from a face, when a fatal error occurs.</p>
<h4 id="section-8.3.4"><tt>find-flag</tt></h4>
<p>This finds a face with a specific flag set, relative to the given face.</p>
<h4 id="section-8.3.5"><tt>find-relative-face</tt></h4>
<p>Finds a specific face relative to a given face, traversing deeply and using specific criteria. Has refinement <tt>/reverse</tt> to move backwards in the layout.</p>
<h4 id="section-8.3.6"><tt>find-style</tt></h4>
<p>Finds a face by style name, relative to the given face. Has refinement <tt>/reverse</tt> to move backwards in the layout.</p>
<h4 id="section-8.3.7"><tt>focus</tt></h4>
<p>This focuses a specific face without setting the focus ring. It runs the <tt>on-focus</tt> key formatter.</p>
<h4 id="section-8.3.8"><tt>get-tab-face</tt></h4>
<p>Returns the tab face for the window in which the given face resides.</p>
<h4 id="section-8.3.9"><tt>get-tip-face</tt></h4>
<p>Used internally to find the last face in the last pane inside a pane. This is used to determine for <tt>traverse-face</tt>, when the pane has been traversed.</p>
<h4 id="section-8.3.10"><tt>inside-face?</tt></h4>
<p>Returns whether a given face exists inside the pane of another face. This is used when switching pane in a panel, and you want to make sure that any face that was tab focused there, is properly unfocused.</p>
<h4 id="section-8.3.11"><tt>iterated-face?</tt></h4>
<p>This determines if the given face is correctly set for iteration. If it returns <tt>true</tt>, then the face has a proper iteration function.</p>
<h4 id="section-8.3.12"><tt>iterated-pane</tt></h4>
<p>This is a uniform way to evaluate the first entry in an iterated face. It is used to determine subfaces inside an iterated face.</p>
<h4 id="section-8.3.13"><tt>move-face</tt></h4>
<p>This moves the upper left corner of the face without disturbing the lower right corner of the face. Thus the face is both moved and resized.</p>
<h4 id="section-8.3.14"><tt>next-face</tt></h4>
<p>Finds the face next to the current one in the same pane. Has refinement <tt>/deep</tt> to traverse one step forward deeply in the layout.</p>
<h4 id="section-8.3.15"><tt>restore-flags</tt></h4>
<p>This restores the flag setup for the given face from <tt>face/saved-flags</tt>, saved by <tt>save-flags</tt>. This is used for functions that manipulate the feel of the face, such as <tt>disable-face</tt>.</p>
<h4 id="section-8.3.16"><tt>root-face</tt></h4>
<p>Returns the window in which the given face resides.</p>
<h4 id="section-8.3.17"><tt>save-face</tt></h4>
<p>Saves the content of the current <tt>focal-face</tt> being edited.</p>
<h4 id="section-8.3.18"><tt>save-flags</tt></h4>
<p>Saves the flag setup for the given face in <tt>face/saved-flags</tt>. This is used for functions that manipulate the feel of the face, such as <tt>disable-face</tt>.</p>
<h4 id="section-8.3.19"><tt>traverse-face</tt></h4>
<p>Traverses the pane of a face deeply and performs an action on each found face.</p>
<h4 id="section-8.3.20"><tt>unfocus</tt></h4>
<p>This removes key event focus from a face and runs the <tt>on-unfocus</tt> key formatter. It does not alter the focus ring.</p>
<h4 id="section-8.3.21"><tt>validate-face</tt></h4>
<p>This validates a single face or a whole window. It's used internally to perform initial condition validation on window open, when a <tt>TRUE-BUTTON</tt> validates the window and when a single face is validated when pressing <b>Tab</b>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-8.4">Accessors</h3>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="section-8.4.1"><tt>setup-face</tt></h4>
<p>This sets the face up, if the face supports setup. This counts for faces that may have sophisticated panes or elements that are allowed to dynamically change during its lifetime.</p>
<h4 id="section-8.4.2"><tt>set-face</tt></h4>
<p>This sets the face value.</p>
<h4 id="section-8.4.3"><tt>get-face</tt></h4>
<p>This returns the face value.</p>
<h4 id="section-8.4.4"><tt>reset-face</tt></h4>
<p>This resets the face to its default value.</p>
<h4 id="section-8.4.5"><tt>key-face</tt></h4>
<p>This sends a key event to the face, so it can be processed internally. For example, you can process the cursor keys in a list view separately from the global key handlers in <tt>window/feel/detect</tt>. For key-face to work, the face must be tab-focused, but it is not required that the cursor is present for editing.</p>
<h4 id="section-8.4.6"><tt>scroll-face</tt></h4>
<p>This scrolls the face vertically or horizontally. The style can use separate functions for each direction.</p>
<h4 id="section-8.4.7"><tt>disable-face</tt></h4>
<p>This disables a previously enabled face. The face will appear "dulled" and is no longer accepting user input or tabbing. It can, however, still be managed with <tt>setup-face</tt>, <tt>set-face</tt> and <tt>get-face</tt>.</p>
<h4 id="section-8.4.8"><tt>enable-face</tt></h4>
<p>This enables a previously disabled face.</p>
<h4 id="section-8.4.9"><tt>save-face</tt></h4>
<p>This saves the content of the face and thus makes it possible to do a GET-FACE. This is useful if you are writing in a field and then click a button without unfocusing the field by hand.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="section-9">Special Style Features</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Some styles provide special features that require an in-depth explanation.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-9.1">Panel Switching</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Panels are capable of providing multiple panes. You can specify the panes directly in layout:</p>
<pre>
view make-window [
    p: panel setup [
        general [
            h1 "General"
            ... General setup layout here...
        ]
        network [
            h1 "Network"
            ... network setup layout here...
        ]
        printer [
            h1 "Printer"
            ... printer setup layout here...
        ]
    ]
]
</pre>
<p>When using multiple panes, the panel is resized after the largest pane. When you want to switch the pane, you use SET-FACE on the panel, along with a word that matches the pane name:</p>
<pre>
set-face p 'printer
</pre>
<p>When only one panel is defined like normally, the pane name is <tt>'default</tt>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-9.2">Panel Setting and Getting</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>When getting and setting data, you most likely want to do it in large chunks, for example when doing it for many fields in a form.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-9.3">Lists</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Lists are much more capable and come in several levels of usage. Here is a brief list:</p>
<table cellspacing="6" border="0" width="95%">
<tr><td width="20">&nbsp;</td><td valign="top" width="80"><b>LIST</b></td><td valign="top">Basic vertically iterated face
</td></tr>
<tr><td width="20">&nbsp;</td><td valign="top" width="80"><b>DATA-LIST</b></td><td valign="top">Provides a list with selectable rows, but no scroller
</td></tr>
<tr><td width="20">&nbsp;</td><td valign="top" width="80"><b>PARAMETER-LIST</b></td><td valign="top">Two-column list setup, meant for displaying object contents.
</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-9.4">Scrollers</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Scrollers can automatically attach to faces that contain the SCROLLABLE flag.</p>
<p>This example demonstrates automatic attachment:</p>
<pre>
letters: [a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]

view make-window [
    across
    data-list 100x300 with [source: :letters]
    scroller
]
</pre>
<p>You can then attach a second scroller, which will then control the horizontal movement for the list. We will then need to provide a more complex source.</p>
<pre>
view make-window [
    across
    data-list 100x300 with [source: :letters]
    scroller with [fill: none] 20x300 return
    scroller 100x20
]
</pre>
<p>Under normal circumstances, you should not need to customize scrolling, but it's possible to do.</p>
<p>Scrolling occurs internally using the SCROLL-FACE function. The SCROLL-FACE function calls the <tt>scroll-face*</tt> accessor in the face to be scrolled. Parameters for direction and step size are given.</p>
<p>The <tt>scroll-face*</tt> accessor then provides instructions for how the face to scroll should change, scrolling vertically or horizontally. For a DATA-LIST, scrolling vertically results in the data list starting index to be moved, while scrolling horizontally results in the subface for the data list to be moved to a new offset.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-9.5">Face Interaction</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>As a new concept, face interaction is the consolidation of handling all programmatic interactions with a face through their accessors. This is a rule, that should be followed. Some faces generally expose three different attributes:</p>
<table cellspacing="6" border="0" width="95%">
<tr><td width="20">&nbsp;</td><td valign="top" width="80"><b>Setup</b></td><td valign="top">The setup of the face. For a SELECTOR, that would be the buttons used. This only counts for faces that need to construct a specific layout inside themselves. PANELs and FACE-CONSTRUCTs do this too. This is handled through the <tt>setup-face</tt> function. The face would hold the value internally in <tt>setup</tt>.
</td></tr>
<tr><td width="20">&nbsp;</td><td valign="top" width="80"><b>Default</b></td><td valign="top">The default value of the face. For any face this is handled with RESET-FACE.
</td></tr>
<tr><td width="20">&nbsp;</td><td valign="top" width="80"><b>Value</b></td><td valign="top">This is the value set for the face. This is handled with SET-FACE and GET-FACE.
</td></tr>
</table>
<p>A typical style setup for general interaction:</p>
<pre>
MY-FACE: FACE with [
access: make object! [
    set-face*: func [face value] [
        face/data: value
    ]
    get-face*: func [face] [
        face/data
    ]
    setup-face*: func [face value] [
        face/pane: layout/tight process value
    ]
    reset-face*: func [face] [
        face/set-face* face/default
    ]
]
]
</pre>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-9.6">Key Formatting</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Fields provide key formatters. This is real-time replacement of text, altering of highlight and caret position as you perform key presses or, when using the Enter or <b>Tab</b> key. The idea is to use this for auto-completion, string replacement, capitalization, numeric only fields, etc.</p>
<p>To provide a key formatter, you determine when you want to use the formatter:</p>
<table cellspacing="6" border="0" width="95%">
<tr><td width="20">&nbsp;</td><td valign="top" width="80"><b>on-key</b></td><td valign="top">Formatter is applied on each key press
</td></tr>
<tr><td width="20">&nbsp;</td><td valign="top" width="80"><b>on-return</b></td><td valign="top">Formatter is applied each time Enter is pressed. This makes it possible to apply a formatter without leaving a field.
</td></tr>
<tr><td width="20">&nbsp;</td><td valign="top" width="80"><b>on-tab</b></td><td valign="top">Formatter is applied when <b>Tab</b> is pressed, just before leaving the field.
</td></tr>
<tr><td width="20">&nbsp;</td><td valign="top" width="80"><b>on-set</b></td><td valign="top">Formatter is applied when using SET-FACE on the field
</td></tr>
<tr><td width="20">&nbsp;</td><td valign="top" width="80"><b>on-escape</b></td><td valign="top">Formatter is applied when pressing the Escape key
</td></tr>
<tr><td width="20">&nbsp;</td><td valign="top" width="80"><b>on-focus</b></td><td valign="top">Formatter is applied when focusing
</td></tr>
<tr><td width="20">&nbsp;</td><td valign="top" width="80"><b>on-unfocus</b></td><td valign="top">Formatter is applied when unfocusing
</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Formatter definitions are read as a function name and an argument. If the formatter does not require arguments, <tt>none</tt> should be passed.</p>
<h4 id="section-9.6.1">Examples</h4>
<p>This provides a field that automatically capitalizes the first char and subsequent chars that come after a space.</p>
<pre>
view make-window [
    field on-key [capitalize none]
]
</pre>
<p>This auto-completes from a list of names. Just start typing and matching letters will complete the field.</p>
<pre>
names: [
    "eenie"
    "meenie"
    "miney"
    "moe"
]
view make-window [
    field on-key [auto-complete names]
]
</pre>
<p>You can provide multiple formatters sequentially:</p>
<pre>
view make-window [
    field on-key [auto-complete names capitalize none]
]
</pre>
<p>You can also provide your own formatters. Each formatter is a function of the format:</p>
<pre>
format-func: func [face event value] [
    ... perform formatting ...
    make object! [
        text:           ...altered text...
        highlight-start:    ...altered highlight start...
        highlight-end:  ...altered highlight end...
        caret:          ...altered caret position...
    ]
]
</pre>
<p>The name of the function is used in the layout definition block.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-9.7">Balancing</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>There are two new faces that provide balancing between two panels of faces. Given how they work, it's necessary to explain them here.</p>
<h4 id="section-9.7.1">Balancer</h4>
<p>The <tt>balancer</tt> style is usually placed between two panels, but any resizable face can be used. When you pull it up or down, left or right, depending on the intended resize direction, which is autodetected, the panel before and after are resized so that the space that all three faces occupy remain the same. The balancer will not go beyond the edges of both panels.</p>
<p>The balancer only works properly, when the panels before and after it are placed logically before and after the balancer in the pane.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
view make-window [
    across
    box red "1"
    balancer
    box orange "2"
]
</pre>
<p>As calculated by the layout:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/balancer1.png"></p>
<p>When moving the balancer to the right:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/balancer2.png"></p>
<h4 id="section-9.7.2">Resizer</h4>
<p>The <tt>resizer</tt> is also placed between two faces, but where it will resize the panel before it, the remaining faces that come after it, are simply moved. This style is extensively used in the <tt>list-header</tt> style to resize columns.</p>
<p>Like <tt>balancer</tt>, <tt>resizer</tt> only works properly when situated between the faces that need to be resized and moved.</p>
<pre>
view make-window [
    across
    box red "1"
    resizer
    box blue "2"
    resizer
    box orange "3"
]
</pre>
<p>As calculated by the layout:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/resizer1.png"></p>
<p>When moving the first resizer to the right:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/resizer2.png"></p>
<p>When moving the second resizer as far to the left as possible:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/resizer3.png"></p>
<p>The second face is not lost. It was simply horizontally sized to zero:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/resizer4.png"></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-9.8">Enablers</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>An ENABLER is a checkbox like face, that enables or disables a face that comes right after it. This is used in cases where a face needs to represent many values, such as in a form that allows mass-editing of table rows.</p>
<p>When an enabler is enabled, the following happens:</p>
<ul>
<li>The next face is enabled and focused.</li>
<li>Initial condition for validation is set.</li>
</ul>
<p>When an enabler is disabled, the following happens:</p>
<ul>
<li>The next face is disabled and unfocused.</li>
<li>Validation is turned off for this face. If the form is validated, this face is skipped.</li>
<li>The face is cleared.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="section-9.8.1">Example</h4>
<pre>
view make-window [across enabler field validate [empty? get-face face]]
</pre>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="section-10">Style Reference</h2>

<h2 id="section-11">Future</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The VID Extension Kit and its documentation is very incomplete, and so the work must continue on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Making it simpler, more consistent and cleaner</li>
<li>Making more styles</li>
<li>Fix a lot of bugs</li>
<li>Finish documentation</li>
