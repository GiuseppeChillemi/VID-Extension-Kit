VID Extension Kit - Extra Functions (unfinished)

===Introduction

This document is not yet finished.

Some functions work as helpers when creating styles. These are listed in this document.

===Functions

---HINGE

This function "hinges" one face to another by corner. This is useful, when aligning corners of faces, such as a face which opens a menu and the opened menu face. Hinging occurs only once and does not provide new resize information that would allow the hinge to be persistent.

A hinge may occur at one of the four corners of each face and is described by two words in a block out of four:

:left - Describes the left edge of the face

:right - Describes the right edge of the face

:top - Describes the top edge of the face

:bottom - Describes the bottom edge of the face

So, if you specify a corner as [top right], the top right corner will be used as a hinging point.

When hinging the first face never moves. Only the second face is moved into the desired position.

Both faces must exist in a layout and must have a size and an offset.

HINGE works best, if alignment and resizing has already occurred.

+++Example

Hinge the bottom right corner of face 1 to the top right corner of face 2

	hinge face1 [bottom right] face2 [top right]

---FACE-SIZE-TEXT

Provides the size of a text when taking the face edge and origin into account.

+++Example

	face-size-text my-face

---FACE-SIZE-FROM-TEXT

Is used to determine the horizontal or the vertical size of a face from it's text. This is useful for body text faces, that layout large amounts of text according to a specified width of a document.

The direction is determined if one direction of the size of a face is -1.

At this time, the maximum size that is used for calculation is 1000 pixels.

+++Example

	face-size-from-text ???
