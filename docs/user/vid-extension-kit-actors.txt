VID Extension Kit Actors

===Introduction

Actors are an easy-access way to perform a task on a specific event, such as doing something on a button click or when a list face refreshes its content.

Basically there is just a list of actors and each one does something differently at different times.

Actors are primarily used in FEEL objects and in styles, but you can call any actor in any face at any time.

There are no fixed rules on when to call an actor, so this document also serves as a list of rules on when to use particular actors as a style writer.

===Actors

---Calling Actors

When creating your own styles or when using actors, you call actors by the ACT-FACE function:

	act-face face 'on-click

---Attach Actor Functions

Each face has an actor object in FACE/ACTORS. This provides a complete list of functions that are attached to this face.

Each actor in the object contains a block, where all functions reside. When ACT-FACE is called on this actor, all functions in that block are run in sequence. Any actor can contain any number of functions.

To insert a new actor function for a face, you use the INSERT-ACTOR-FUNC function:

	my-func: func [face value event actor] [now]
	insert-actor-func face 'on-click :my-func

The function can support up to 4 arguments. You don't have to use them all, but the arguments will be served in the following order:

:face - The face for which the actor is called.

:value - The value passed to the function via GET-FACE.

:event - The event object that was present, when ACT-FACE was called. Sometimes, there can be no event object, if ACT-FACE is run outside a FEEL object, so the value will then be NONE.

:actor - The name of the actor that is called by ACT-FACE.

When attempting to insert the same function multiple times, INSERT-ACTOR-FUNC first investigates if the function already exists in the block. If it does, the insertion is skipped.

---Remove Actor Functions

You can remove actor functions by using the REMOVE-ACTOR-FUNC function:

	remove-actor-func face 'on-click :my-func

---Debugging Actors

Actors can be debugged, as in you can see which actors are called in the console, if inserting the 'actors flag in CTX-VID-DEBUG:

	insert ctx-vid-debug/debug 'actors
